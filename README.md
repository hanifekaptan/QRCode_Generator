# QRCode_Generator
The application, developed using Python, PyQt5, PyQt5 Designer, Python Barcode and Segno, converts data in various formats into QRCode and 2D Barcode form. This application aims to easily convert data in existing forms into QRCode with a simple interface.

Shortcomings and weakness:
1. The output produced by converting it to QRCode is not stored somewhere and is completely lost when another output is produced.
2. The current QRCode is kept in the file named output.png in the directory where the application is installed. The user must copy this file to access the output.
